# Code of Conduct

Open source software is thriving. Large corporations are building on software that rests on open collaboration, enjoying the many benefits of significant community adoption. Free and open source software is amazing for its ability to bring together many people from all over the world, and join their efforts and skills by their interests.

That said, and because we come from so many different backgrounds, it’s worth taking a moment to reflect on how we work together. The manner in which you conduct yourself while working with others can sometimes impact whether your work is merged, whether someone works on your issue, or in some cases, why you might be blocked from participating in the repository in the future. This post was written to guide people as best as possible on how to keep these communications running smoothly. Here’s a bullet point list of etiquette in open source to help you have a more enjoyable time in the community and contribute to making it a better place.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting HR. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/), version 1.4, available at <http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4>. For more information read the [TODO groups site](http://todogroup.org/opencodeofconduct/).

## For the Maintainer

* Use labels like help wanted or good first issue to guide people to issues they can work on if they are new to the project.
* When running benchmarks, show the authors of the framework/library/etc the code you’re going to run to benchmark on before running it. Allow them to PR (it’s ok to give a deadline). That way when your benchmark is run you know they have your approval and it’s as fair as possible. This also fixes issues like benchmarking dev instead of prod or some user errors.
* When you ask someone for help or label an issue help wanted and someone PRs, please write a comment explaining why you are closing it if you decide not to merge. It’s disrespectful of their time otherwise, as they were following your call to action. I would even go so far as to say it would be nice to comment on any PR that you close OR merge, to explain why or say thank you, respectively.
* Don’t close a PR from an active contributor and reimplement the same thing yourself. Just… don’t do this.
* If a fight breaks out on an issue that gets personal, shut it down to core maintainers as soon as possible. Lock the issue and ensure to enforce the code of conduct if necessary.

## For the User

* Saying thank you for the project before making an inquiry about a new feature or filing a bug is usually appreciated.
* When opening an issue, create a small, isolated, simple, reproduction of the issue using an online code editor (like codepen or codesandbox) if possible and a GitHub repository if not. The process may help you discover the underlying issue (or realize that it’s not an issue with the project). It will also make it easier for maintainers to help you resolve the problem.
* When opening an issue, please suggest a solution to the problem. Take a few minutes to do a little digging. This [blog post](https://blog.kentcdodds.com/what-open-source-project-should-i-contribute-to-7d50ecfe1cb4) has a few suggestions for how to dive into the source code a little. If you’re not sure, explain you’re unsure what to do.
* When opening an issue, if you’re unable to resolve it yourself, please explain that. The expectation is that you resolve the issues you bring up. If someone else does it, that’s a gift they’re giving to you (so you should express the appropriate gratitude in that case).
* Don’t file issues that say things like “is this even maintained anymore?” A comment like this is insulting to the time they have put in, it reads as though the project is not valid anymore just because they needed a break, or were working on something else, or their parent died or they had a kid or any other myriad human reasons for not being at the beck and call of code. It’s totally ok to ask if there’s a roadmap for the future, or to decide based on past commits that it’s not maintained enough for your liking. It’s not ok to be passive aggressive to someone who created something for you for free.
* If someone respectfully declines a PR because, though valid code, it’s not the direction they’d like to take the project, don’t keep commenting on the pull request.
* When you want to submit a really large pull request to a project you’re not a core contributor on, it’s a good idea to ask via an issue if the direction you’d like to go makes sense. This also means you’re more likely to get the pull request merged because you have given them a heads up and communicated the plan. Better yet, break it into smaller pull requests so that it’s not too much to grok at one time.
* Avoid entitlement. The maintainers of the project don’t owe you anything. When you start using the project, it becomes your responsibility to help maintain it. If you don’t like the way the project is being maintained, be respectful when you provide suggestions and offer help to improve the situation.
* Before doing anything on a project, familiarize yourself with the contributor guidelines.
