# Cross-Domain Prototype

The following is meant to showcase posting messages to an `iframe` and storing that data into `IndexedDB`.

While you can run the demo locally, its much more difficult than it should be, and thus there is an iframe hosted at <https://iamnewton.github.io/cdn/iframe.test.html> and a parent page hosted at <https://languid-radical-oyster.glitch.me/> calling the iframe and storing values into `IndexedDB`.

Following the [discussion in GitHub](https://github.com/MagniteEngineering/fledge.polyfill/discussions/7), this will be used in how store our Interest Groups and run auctions.
